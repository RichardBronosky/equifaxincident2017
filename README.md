# It's clear that Equifax knows nothing about security.
If they did, they would be conditioning their <strike>victims</strike> users to go to security2017.equifax.com rather than www.equifaxsecurity2017.com.

# Why is this a problem?
There is nothing to stop anyone from buying a domain that **includes your trademark**. The only protection anyone has is on **domains you own**.
## What's the difference?

### A [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name)...
is easiest described as "your name dot com". But you know that not all sites are "dot coms". There are also "dot net" and "dot org" as well as "dot edu" and "dot gov". Is that all? Not even close. All of these different "after the dot" portions are called "Top Level Domains". There are a lot of them, but they are finite. So a domain is more accurately described as "your name dot top level domain".

### A [trademark](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-getting-started/trademark-basics/trademark-patent-or-copyright)...
identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. You know equifax owns equifax.com. That is their "primary domain". Why is it primary? Because the public trusts its officiality more than anything else. More than anything else? Like what? Well, if I told you, "go to IHateEquifax.com" then you would expect that it is not an official Equifax site.
